# Final Semester Project - RPG Console Game
Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a terminal-based RPG game using C/C++. This project encourages creativity as students are free to choose the game's theme (e.g., vampires, wizards, elves, knights, princesses), enabling them to create unique narratives and characters.

# Purpose
This project is designed to deepen students' understanding of C/C++ through hands-on application. By incorporating essential features like structs, functions, arrays, and file handling, students will experience how these components come together in a game environment. The project also introduces practical concepts like game data management and user interaction through file reading/writing and console menus, making for a robust entry into basic game development.

# Minimum Requirements
The game must meet the following C/C++ requirements:

Structures (structs) for organizing character or game data
Functions to modularize tasks, enhancing code readability and maintainability
Arrays for efficient data storage and manipulation within the game
File I/O for saving and loading player progress or game states
Initial Interaction Menu to provide a simple user interface
